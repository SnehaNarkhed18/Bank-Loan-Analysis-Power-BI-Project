# **Bank-Loan-Analysis-Power-BI-Project**
Welcome to the Bank Loan Analysis Power BI project repository! This project aims to provide insightful analysis and visualization of bank loan data using Power BI.

## **Overview**
This Power BI project analyzes various aspects of bank loans to provide valuable insights for decision-making. It comprises three main dashboards: Summary, Overview, and Details.

## **Dashboard 1: Summary**
### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:**
**1.	Total Loan Applications:** We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).
**2.	Total Funded Amount:** Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an
eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.
**3.	Total Amount Received:** Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over- Month (MoM) changes.
**4.	Average Interest Rate:** Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-Month
(MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.
**5.	Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.

### **Good Loan v Bad Loan KPI’s**
**Good Loan:**
1.	Good Loan Application Percentage
2.	Good Loan Applications
3.	Good Loan Funded Amount
4.	Good Loan Total Received Amount

**Bad Loan**
1.	Bad Loan Application Percentage
2.	Bad Loan Applications
3.	Bad Loan Funded Amount
4.	Bad Loan Total Received Amount

### **Loan Status Grid View**
In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status.’ By providing insights into metrics such as 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),' this grid view will empower us to make data-driven decisions and assess the health of our loan portfolio.

## **Dashboard 2: Overview**
### **Charts**
**1.	Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):** To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities
**2.	Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map):** To identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional
disparities
**3.	Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):** To allow the client to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.
**4.	Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart):** How lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different
employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.
**5.	Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):** Will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing.
**6.	Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map):** For a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and
disbursements.

## **Dashboard 3: Details**
### **Objective**
The Details Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key loan-related metrics and data points, facilitating efficient access to critical information about loan portfolios, borrower profiles, and loan performance.

### **Grid**
Need for a comprehensive 'Details Dashboard' that provides a consolidated view of all the essential information within our loan data. This Details Dashboard aims to offer a holistic snapshot of key loan-related metrics and data points, enabling users to access critical information efficiently.

### **Dataset Used**
The bank loan analysis dataset comprises essential fields such as Loan ID, Address State, Purpose, Grade, Sub Grade, Annual Income, Loan Status, Last Payment Date, Verification Status, Debt-to-Income Ratio, and Interest Rates. These fields provide insights into borrower demographics, employment stability, loan characteristics, risk assessment, and payment behavior.

### **Conclusion**
The Details Dashboard streamlines access to critical loan data, facilitating informed decision-making, enhancing operational efficiency, optimizing lending strategies, mitigating risks, and maximizing overall performance.
